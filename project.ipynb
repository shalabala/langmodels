      "he 'd seen the movie almost by mistake , considering he was a little young for the pg cartoon , but with older cousins , along with her brothers , mason was often exposed to things that were older .\n",
      "she liked to think being surrounded by adults and older kids was one reason why he was a such a good talker for his age .\n",
